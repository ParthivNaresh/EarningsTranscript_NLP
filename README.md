# Parsing Earnings Transcripts

## The Background
Every quarter, a public company is required to submit a report of its past quarter's financial performance and will usually provide some sort of guidance.
Alongside a 10-Q (for U.S.-based companies) submission to the SEC, key management will also hold an earnings call, in which they will verbally describe
their performance, future plans, and provide any updates. They will also take questions from analysts who try to further gauge the position of the company.
A transcript of this earnings call is available soon after it takes place.

## The Significance
The earnings call provides one of the few human interactions with company management that investors, both current and prospective, get to witness.
Although the performance of a company in the quarter can affect how the market trades its stock at market open, either fortunately or not, it's often the
future guidance given that determines how the stock moves the next day. These quarterly reports are the most significant information that the public receives
about the company and outside of company-specific events or macroeconomic, market-moving news, they are the main pieces of data the market digests as it
trades the stock in the ensuing weeks.

## The Potential
It's the job of management to stress the good news and downplay the bad. The language that's used (or not used) can be indicative of how management feels about
their performance so far and where things are headed.
